## Untested devices
Other Eufy models should also work but might not be recognized incompletely or require a config file.
See the full list [here](https://bropat.github.io/eufy-security-client/#/supported_devices)
<br>If your model is not listed above or some controls are missing please send me the results of these commands:

    $ cd /var/www/html/plugins/eufy
    $ ./resources/eufy -d device_serial test

where `device_serial` is your device serial number, starting by `Txxx`
<br>

## Troubleshooting
* Prerequisites not found
<br> `docker` prerequisites are now installed automatically using the `dependencies` button when the mode is set to `local`
<br> `python_venv` prerequisite is now installed automatically on `debian 12`
* Eufy deamon fails to start
<br>Check the docker image, container and cloud login status indicators (see below).
<br>If the docker image is properly installed its version will be displayed on the `installed version` line.
<br>Both container and cloud login status indicators must be green (see below).
<br>Use the `eufy` script the script in `resources` to get more info. 
See the [Local mode (expert)](docs/en_US/index.md#configuration) documentation section for details.
```
        eufy status # check the image and container status
        eufy info # check the image and container status (extended info)
        eufy test # check if the container is connected to the eufy cloud
        eufy logs # get the container logs
```
* Docker container indicator (left) is red
<br> Docker image install failed or container fails to start. Make sure your image is property installed
<br> Note: @bropat does not provide armv7 (Pi3) images anymore, latest one is 1.7.1
* Eufy Cloud indicator (right) is red
<br> A red Cloud indicator means the Eufy cloud authentication failed or Eufy prevents you from connecting for security reasons.
Verify that your Eufy login, password and device name are correct.
* Synchronization failed, devices are not found
<br> Apostrophes and quotes are not supported in equipment names
* Incompatible schema error, commands not working
<br> Make sure you're using the correct `eufy-security-ws` [release](https://github.com/bropat/eufy-security-ws/releases).
<br> Your installed image version is displayed in the plugin config page when hitting the `Tester` button.
<br> If you've upgraded the plugin you might try to uninstall/reinstall the image and restart the container.
* Some actions change the corresponding property but there's no change on the device (eg flash on/off)
<br> These are not actions but device settings that will only impact its behavior for the next detection 
(eg the flash will light at the next event)
* Cam snapshots don't update
<br> Enable snapshots in the Eufy app: `Device > Parameters > Notification`

## Known issues
* Some commands don't [work as expected](https://github.com/bropat/eufy-security-ws/issues/212) on some devices
* 2FA is not supported yet, please use a secondary account with 2FA disabled
* P2P streaming is not supported, use RTSP when available instead
